## 1. Introduction
ExStreamly Cheap is a real time scalable deals serving platform. It provides Insights and searching capabilities, maximizing time and profit for end users. 
For three weeks, I worked on www.exstreamlycheap.club using open source tools to create a single platform for inspiration, search, shopping and serving of deals. I leveraged Sqoot's API to gather deals aggregated over different vendors, providers and categories.
A naive recommendation framework is also implemented making it very easy to plug in more robust collaborative filtering or item-item/item-user affinity implementations; to solve more business use cases.

## 2. Motivation
As a techy and gagdet lover, I noticed that I spent a lot of time scouting various sites for the best deals. We all know the importance of savings while getting amazing items at amazing bargains. Searching platforms like Amazon, Groupon and others is a trivial thing. And there are tons of coupons and deals providing sites. However, what makes a deal a deal? Are the prices a real representation of an actual discount when compared to the manufacturers MSRP or is there a third-party mockup? How can a certain deal be addressed and personalized? There isn't a platform that offered a complete, provider agnostic, user-defined preference inspired platform. ExStreamly cheap is my proposed solution to a one-everything platform to solve this problem. From inspiration, search, shopping to recommendations of details based on preferences. My end goal is to develop a notification system on the platform to alert users when deals that match their interest arrive in real time; location based interests, price, discount rate or other interest. This will require plugging in a specialized robust collaborative filtering, affinity inspired recommendation system.

## 3. Engineering Solution
During the program, the following queries were successfully constructed and executed.
1. A holistic view of real time trends and purchase visualizations.
2. Deals search based on price and discount options.
3. Display of recommendations based on engineered user interaction with respect to trends and sales.
4. Users purchasing patterns and interactions: location-based and reviews.
